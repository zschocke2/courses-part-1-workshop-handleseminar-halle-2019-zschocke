## Load and plot RRI data

```yaml
type: NormalExercise
key: 2bafef99a3
lang: r
xp: 100
skills: 1
```

In our second workshop we will have a look on R-peaks and respiration data.

But let's simply start with R-peaks, R-peaks are derived from ECGs and describes the point of the main heart contraction. Here we use a dataset of 36 000 heart beats from a signle night of a random subject in the sleep laboratories of Charit√© Berlin. 

First the R-peaks are stored in sampling units of ```256 Hz```, which means we have to devide each point by the sampling rate to obtain the time in seconds.
Furthermore we can calculate the heart rate as the reciprocal of the R-R distance/RR-interval (RRI)

`@instructions`
1. Load data 
2. Convert R-peak-points into time in seconds
3. Calculate the heart rate. Use the first R-Interval as the time point of the heart rate.
