## Load and plot RRI data

In our second workshop we will have a look on R-peaks and respiration data.

But let's simply start with R-peaks, R-peaks are derived from ECGs and describes the point of the main heart contraction. Here we use a dataset of 36 000 heart beats from a signle night of a random subject in the sleep laboratories of Charit√© Berlin. 

First the R-peaks are stored in sampling units of ```256 Hz```, which means we have to 

`@instructions`
1. Load data 
2. Convert R-peak-points into

`@hint`


`@pre_exercise_code`
```{r}

```

`@sample_code`
```{r}
# Load data
rri <- scan('data.rri')
```
